This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Java involving loop control. The `BuggyLoop.java` file contains code that uses a `break` statement to prematurely terminate a `while` loop, resulting in unexpected behavior. The `FixedLoop.java` file provides a corrected version that prints numbers from 0 to 9 as expected.  This example highlights the importance of careful loop management and understanding the implications of control flow statements like `break`.
